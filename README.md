## Motivation
This project investigates the use of ML models in classifying names by nationality and gender.  
The code in this repository is used to fill in the blog post on medium which can be found at https://medium.com/@samantha.green/names-linking-to-nationality-and-gender-c7cc7c4a3bcc

### Questions Asked
Can a model predict a person's nationality accurately given only a first name?

Can a model predict a person's gender accurately given only a first name?

## Data
Kaggle data set with 4,695 names along with gender and nationality.

## Installation 
Packages used include numby, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn

## Aditional Notes
Rather than impute values to fix missing data I chose to remove the effected columns or rows based on the large data set that remained even after all the needed deletions. In a future itteration, I could add the imputed values. 

## Files

## Resolution
While older and less educated populations see higher incidence of diabetes, predicting your chances of getting diabetes involves more factors than a person’s age, weight, income, education, race, mental health, gender, and state of residence.
